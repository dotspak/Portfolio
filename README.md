## React, Game Development, Design

### Intro
Welcome to my programming and design portfolio! I’m a budding game developer with a strong passion for audio, 
UI, and UX design. I love creating interactive experiences that feel intuitive and immersive—from playful 
sound systems to clean, minimal interfaces.

### Contents
#### React Project
The PikminMusic folder contains a React project I developed during university. Inspired by the 
dynamic layering audio system in Pikmin 2, this app allows users to toggle individual music layers in 
real time—customizing their listening experience right from a mobile device. In addition to its audio 
engine, the app integrates the Reddit API, enabling users to peacefully browse Reddit while enjoying 
ambient music. Currently, the app includes a single song, but it’s fully extensible to support any 
number of tracks in the future.

#### Screenshots
While I can't publicly share the full code for my personal game projects, I’ve included a set of 
screenshots showcasing my current work. These images span various stages of development—from its 
early days as a 2D pixel art game to its current form as a 3D low-poly experience. The screenshots 
also highlight my approach to UI design. For this project, I adopted a minimalist, terminal-inspired 
interface to complement the game’s overall aesthetic and mood..
