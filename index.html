                      Welcome to my game development portfolio. This portfolio contains videos and screenshots of my
                      previous projects. I have been seriously developing games for around 4 years now but have been
                      experimenting with it for many years prior. I primarily develop turn-based rpgs with some sort of
                      twist, but I have developed games in other genres before, notably my school project being a platformer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I unfortunately can't include a downloadable version of my school project due to lack of
                      permissions; however, a link to my current project's github has been included with a prototype
                      of my current project. This project is still very early in development and has a few
                      crashes/visual bugs to iron out, but it is playable. More details for that game are in
                      the how to play section.

                              I'm currently working on a grid-based RPG with a simple, yet highly dynamic battle system.
                              The game will also feature heavy randomization similar to randomizers for games like The
                              Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Currently, the game is in a prototype phase and only
                              features the battle system.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              The games battle system will work as so: every playable character has 10 BP max. As long
                              as they have BP to use skills, they can keep taking turns. The player can regain BP through
                              one of two options:
                          </p>
                          <ul class="gameList">
                              <li>Ending the turn</li>
                              <li>Using a red skill that costs HP</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>
                              Playable characters who die will be knocked out for 3 turns (which in this case is whenever
                              they normally would have acted). Waiting the turn count out is the only way to bring them back.
                              This system was designed to make death feel more punishing, since death often feels like a
                              simple status effect to deal with in other RPGs.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              This game will be fairly easy to pick up and learn, but will have a high skill ceiling for
                              players how wish to master the system and venture into the hardest difficulties. Despite
                              it's nature of being easy to learn, the game is planned to be fairly challenging, and
                              the player will not be able to mindlessly play through the game and achieve success.
                          </p>
                          </p>

                              So far with this project, I've had to deal with a few major challenges:
                          </p>
                          <ul class="gameList">

                                  Dealing with enemy pathfinding AI, which required determining who was the closest<br>
                                  playable character and moving towards them
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Dealing with enemy skill hit detection, which required an efficient way to check<br>
                                  all the enemy's skills each turn and all their orientations
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Various math problems for calculating damage and other values
                              </li>

                          <p>
                              There isn't a playable build on my github page yet unfortunately, but I have included a link
                              to check it out regardless.

                              Clips of this game show off some of the shader work I've done, namely the
                              outline effect on the current unit's turn, the unit's breathing/floating effects,
                              and the effects on the cursor.

                              can hurt each other with their skills!

                              level, including the water scrolling, and a shader that dynamically colours the fish.

                              time in the class to polish the level, so the level is still in an early state.
